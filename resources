## Fortinet firewall setup
## The Requirements for setting up a private firewall are a Fortinet VM image and a virtual machine.
## I'll be using VMware for my setup; to download and install the image on your device, use your browser to search for "vmware workstation pro download." This will take you to the VMware website, where you can download the appropriate executable based on your operating system (I'm using Windows).
## The next step is to download the free Fortinet VMimage from the "support.fortinet.com" support website, register, log in, and hover over "VM images" to select the necessary image based on your virtual environment (Fortinet supports many different virtual environments, including cloud platforms). Once you select the necessary virtual machine image, you will be presented with two options: an upgrade version and a new deployment image. Download the new deployment image to initiate a fresh Fortigate setup; the upgrade version is intended for users who currently have an installed firewall and wish to update to the most recent version.

## Installing, configuring, and importing the virtual machine's image are the next steps. If the Fortigate VM image is in a compressed file, be sure to decompress it, change the storage location when importing the file, or leave it at default, and give it a name.

## We only need two network adapters for this Fortigate setup, so after adding the Fortigate image, update the virtual machine settings and leave the memory, CPUs, and hard drive as default. For the Virtual adapter 1, make sure the network connection is set to bridge, this means that this virtual machine will be a member of the physical network, and also be able to ping and access the virtual machine from this physical computer or any device connected to this network. This bridge adapter will act as our WAN or the internet-facing interface.
## The LAN interface, which serves as the internal network interface, must be configured next. Select the Lan segment by clicking on Virtual Adapter 2, then create a new segment and give it the name LAN. The Bridge network will serve as our WAN interface, and this will be our LAN interface. Return to the bridge segment and deselect "connect at power on" for the lan segment as well as any additional virtual adapters under device status. this is to protect against installation errors. once the installation is done we'd put it back on.

## The bridge network needs to be configured as well; by default, it isn't. You can choose whether to use auto-bridging or to specify which physical network adapter to use to bridge the virtual machine. In my case, I chose to use WiFi, but you can also choose your LAN adapter based on your configuration.

## Power on the machine, it will install the fortigate virtual machine, give it time to finish the necessary process, it will format the disk, shutdown and the reboot back up. Upon completion of the startup process, login with the default credetials, username is admin and password is blank. Note that by default when you factory reset or use a newly out of the box device this is always the default passowrd. As soon as this is done you'd be required to change the password to your preferred password credentials immediately, once done you'd be able to access the device.

## Turn off the virtual machine after changing to your preferred credential, click on edit virtual machine settings, enable "connect at power on" for both the bridge adapter and the LAN adapter that was created, leave the other adapters as they are since they aren't configured, click OK to apply. Now power on the virtual machine.

## After turning on the virtual machine, wait for the startup process to be completed. Minimize this and click on the fortigate virtual machine, go to settings, ensure the network status is correct, ensure both "connected and connect at power on" are enabled, do this for both the bridgeand LAN adapter. Now you can login with your configured credentials.
## Next is to configure the system interfaces. type "config system interfaces" and press enter, specify the interface to be configured by entering "edit port1", this is the bridge adapter which will be the WAN or the interface facing the internet. next enter "set mode dhcp", this means that this interface would receive an IP address automatically from the physical network. next is "set role WAN" since this is the internet facing interface. You can also set alias based on based on your preference, set alias WAN using the command "set alias WAN". Next set allowaccess this is to allow protocols that would be needed to access this interface, using the command "set allowaccess http https telnet ssh ping". http and https for web access, telnet and ssh for cli access, ping to test conecctivity. Next is the command "show" this is to view and verify the configuration. Enter next to configure the port2 interface.

## Configure the LAN interface next. "edit port2" to specify the interface, configure the LAN interface statically using the command "set mode static", "set role lan" since this will the LAN interface, now set your preferred IP address for the LAN interface "set ip 'your lan network/subnet', next set allowaccess for this as well using "set allowaccess http https telnet ssh ping", "set alias internal", enter the command "show" to view and verify the configuration, "end" to exit.

## Enter the command "show system interface", this is to view the interfaces configurations.

## Check the IP that was receieved by the bridge adapter using the command 'get sys int physical"
![next is to get the IP of the physical interface that was given to wan](https://github.com/Bukaslye/Bukaslye/assets/156098907/0352041d-a390-4a48-9dc7-121c92033ad4)
## Ping the Fortigate virtual machine with the IP address given from the physical computer to ensure cnnectivity, remeber that we set access for ping connectivity.

## Since http and https were allowed, we should be able to access the user interface from our physical computer's web browser. Go to the physical computer, open a web browser and enter the IP address of the fortigate virtual machine configured, this should be successful, a web page with the option to enter username and password will be shown if configured properly. Now login with the configured login credentials.
